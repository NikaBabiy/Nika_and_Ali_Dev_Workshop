## Project Description

The **Nika and Ali Dev Workshop** is our MVP project: 
- The part of the mvp app  will serve as a part solution of our start-up "Qalb Le Lev". 
- The project also includes previous milestones Nika and Ali had to do as a part of our deveoper track in MEET. 

**Disclaimer - this is only the minimum viable product and future changes will be done as this project contains 'dummy' parts**

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (LTS version recommended: 14 or above).


2. **Git** (for cloning the repository).

3. **Expo CLI** (installed globally or used via npx):
   ```npm install --global expo-cli ```
   (Alternatively, you can run npx expo commands without installing Expo CLI globally.)
   
4. A device or emulator:

- iOS Simulator (macOS only) via Xcode.

- Android Emulator via Android Studio.

- Or use an actual device with the Expo Go app.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NikaBabiy/Nika_and_Ali_Dev_Workshop.git
   cd Nika_and_Ali_Dev_Workshop
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Depending on the technology stack, run the package manager of your choice. For example (if using Node.js):
```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   
```bash
   yarn
   ```
   This command installs all required libraries declared in the package.json.


3. (Optional) Manually Install Expo Libraries
If your package.json doesn’t already include them, ensure you have the following core libraries for a standard Expo React Native project:

```bash
 npx expo install react react-native expo
```

This aligns the versions of React Native, React, and Expo with the Expo SDK version.

4. (Optional) Other Common Libraries
You might need additional libraries. Some typical ones include:
```bash
 # React Navigation + Related Packages
npx expo install @react-navigation/native
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context 
# (Needed for navigation)

# Redux (if used for state management)
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

# UI Libraries (examples)
npm install react-native-paper
# or
npm install native-base
```

## Running the App

1. ** Start the Development Server
From your project root directory, run:**  
   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```
   -c clears the Expo cache to prevent any build or caching issues.

   This will launch the local development server, allowing you to view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port is set).

2. Open the App

- Mobile Device: Scan the QR code that appears in your terminal or in the Expo Dev Tools using the Expo Go app on your phone.

- iOS Simulator (macOS only): Press i in the terminal.

- Android Emulator: Press a in the terminal.

- Web: Press w in the terminal (if you’re using the web target provided by Expo).
